Code of Conduct: Contributer Covenant Code of Conduct
We chose this code of conduct for multiple reasons. It makes sure that the users know that they are free to use our work no matter "age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation." This important to us and we want everyone to be included and feel safe while working with us. Also, we liked this code of conduct because it not only hit the "dos", but it also hit specific "don'ts". A nice addition to this code of conduct was that it stated each punishment/warning for the user if they don't follow the guidelines.
